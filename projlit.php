<h1>Project Lit</h1>
<h2>Who are we?</h2>
			<p>				Project Lit is a division of Monta  Vista High School's branch of California Scholarship Federation. We work in  collaboration with the organization Room to Read, which strives to eradicate  illiteracy in third world nations and reduce gender disparity in education. Our  work aims to not only provide children in these nations with necessary supplies  (books, school supplies), but also to teach skills, which will instill a  passion for reading and to pursue higher education. More information about Room  to Read can be found <a href="http://www.roomtoread.org/Page.aspx?pid=183">here</a>.</p>
			<h2>How can I help?</h2>
			<p>				Project Lit accepts book donations of  any genre. Books must be children's books or young adult/teenage books. In  order to contribute and receive hours please follow the guidelines for donation  below. You can also support us by buying books during our sales at school, and  other specified locations. 100% of proceeds go directly to Room to Read, which buys  supplies, pay for teachers, and building libraries towards the cause.</p>
